Girl Scout Cookies                          Literally Any                   $4-5/box             11            I mean, come on.
The Rheinlander                             Chocolate Chunk                 $12/6?               10            Consistently delicious, they taste fresh even a couple days after you've bought them. Authentic cookies from an authentic bakery. Pricy, though.
Insomnia                                    Mixed                       $11.19/6 + delivery      9             Actually delicious, delivers until 3AM. Pricy, though.
Perkins                                     Chocolate Chip                  $4/6                 8.5           Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Solid size and solid size of chips. Don't hold their freshness for too long.
7/11                                        Chocolate Chunk                 $1.19/2              8             Soft and crumbly. Chunks are good sized, mixed with chips. Consistent quality.
Subway                                      Mixed                           $1.69/2              8             Crunchier and thinner. Taste impeccable. Quality varies day to day.
Kwik Trip                                   Chocolate Chip                  $2/4?                6             A solid meh. Chip size was weak, a bit crumbly. Soft all around, but not really brown on top, seemed just slightly underdone.
Rendezvous Lodge @ Steamboat Springs        Chocolate Chip                  $3/1                 5             Expensive and meh. A solid addition to my slice of pizza for lunch, but doesn't hold up on its own.
Pepperidge Farm                             Milk Chocolate Macadamia        $3.19/8              5             Size leaves something to be desired. Chocolate chunks are small, though advertised to be large. Almost too crumbly.
