* * * 

It feels like a weight on my chest.\
Sometimes it's light, other times it's heavier than the sun.\
As that sun rises, so too does the weight.\
I open my laptop, the bright light hits my eyes --\
there it is again.

That weight, constantly there makes itself known once again.\
My legs are tight,\
Heavy breathing.\
_How do I make this go away?_

Perhaps I'll take a shower.\
As the water hits my body I feel the pitter patter of requests\
of concerned texts from the people I love\
of email after email filled with empty words\
and as they fall away into the drain I imagine\
for a second\
that maybe I won't see that drop ever again.

As the rain,\
the shower does not stop.\
The weight presses down again.\
I'm lightheaded.

I retreat to bed, with nothing left to give.
