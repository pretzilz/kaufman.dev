This is a short poem I wrote while at a Starbucks listening to a children's message.

* * * 

Let the faithful people rejoice in this honor\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sing for joy on their beds.

On their beds\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their beds of dirt\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their beds of anxiety\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their beds of chains that bind the brain from leaving\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their bed in a sea of storms with waves unrelenting\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their beds without safety and comfort\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their beds of death

Let the faithful people rejoice in this honor\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sing for joy on their beds.

On these beds may the faithful rejoice\
For in these beds \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their life is made\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their spirit grows\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new day is born.
